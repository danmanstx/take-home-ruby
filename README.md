Take home ruby challenge
=======
Take home ruby challenge, slightly unsure on wording to handle bad phones numbers. Currently, they are reported in error report and excluded if nil or number to format (ie. 11 digits already).


## how to run

`ruby Etl.rb`
should end up with an `output.csv` and a `report.txt`

## how to run test
`rspec`

### Transform Rules

- Trim extra white space for all fields
- Transform phone_numbers to E.164 format (Please assume all numbers to be US e.g. +1)
- Transform ALL dates to ISO8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Validation Rules

- Phone Numbers must be E.164 compliant (country code + 10 numeric digits)
- first_name, last_name, dob, member_id, effective_date are ALL required for each patient
